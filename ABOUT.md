# Cerebro Mail

A high-performance, scalable email delivery platform designed for bulk emails, newsletters, and marketing campaigns.

## Overview

Cerebro Mail is a modern email platform built with Go, providing advanced features for sending, tracking, and optimizing email campaigns. This platform is designed as a SaaS solution with multi-tenant support, allowing teams to collaborate on email campaigns with powerful analytics.

## Architecture

### Core Components

Cerebro Mail is built using a microservices architecture with gRPC for internal communication:

- **SMTP Server**: High-performance email sending service written in Go
- **Campaign Management**: Service for managing email campaigns and schedules
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time analytics using Apache Pinot
- **Email Editor**: Rich drag-and-drop template editor
- **AI Integration**: Support for AI-assisted content creation and optimization
- **Team Management**: Multi-tenant support with team collaboration features
- **Billing System**: Subscription management for SaaS model

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang) for performance and concurrency
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js for admin dashboard and editor
- **Internal Communication**: gRPC for service-to-service communication
- **User Data**: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- **Analytics**: Apache Pinot for high-performance analytics
- **Queue**: Redis/RabbitMQ for message processing
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes for orchestration

### Database Strategy

- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user accounts, team data, campaigns, templates, and billing information
- **Apache Pinot**: Handles all analytics data including opens, clicks, bounces, and engagement metrics
